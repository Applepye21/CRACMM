#### Directory contents

- cracmm_mapping_flowchart.pdf: PDF of how individual species map to CRACMM

- cracmm_mapper.py: python code to map individual species to CRACMM mechanism species

- SPECIATEInputs: Speciation table for SPECIATE. Contains representative compound identifiers (DTXSID and name) for all species in SPECIATE.

- SpeciationToolInputs: inputs to Speciation Tool that creates SMOKE-ready mechanism species for profiles. Speciation Tool available at: https://github.com/CMASCenter/Speciation-Tool

- SMOKEInputs: Speciation profiles interms of CRACMM species for use with SMOKE (these are output by Speciation Tool).

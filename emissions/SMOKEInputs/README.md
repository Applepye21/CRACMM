### SMOKE Inputs

Full SMOKE-ready inputs for the entire U.S. for the 2016v3 EPA emissions platform are available [here](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/2016v3-platform). The default 2016v3 scripts are set up to process emissions for a 12km national grid (12US1) using CB6R3AE7 speciation for CMAQ. The platform data also include files to support emissions processing with CRACMM speciation. These files can be found under [ancillary_data folder](https://gaftp.epa.gov/Air/emismod/2016/v3/).  Information on how specific emissions sectors can be processed with CRACMM speciation can be found in section 12 of the [info_2016_v3_platform_package_with_2026gf_22may2023.txt](https://gaftp.epa.gov/Air/emismod/2016/v3/info_2016_v3_platform_package_with_2026gf_22may2023.txt). When using emissions in a specific CMAQ configuration for the first time, please check the main log and at least one processor log for warnings about species being ignored. Some minor changes in naming occur over time that can result in lost mass if names are not synchronized across the emission inputs, DESID control file, and CMAQ model code.

This folder contains example speciation profiles for VOC and PM in terms of CRACMM species for use with SMOKE (these are output by Speciation Tool). SMOKE Inputs include [gspro files](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/2.1/html/ch08s05s02.html) which give the mass fraction of total VOC (or TOG, total organic gas) and/or PM that is each mechanism species for different sectors. 
  For gspro files based on SPECIATE v5.2, a [gscnv file](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/2.1/html/ch08s05.html#sect_input_gscnv) that converts VOC (which is inventoried by EPA in the NEI) to total organic gas (TOG) is also available.  VOC in the NEI is defined by the [code of federal regulation 51.100(s)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2019-title40-vol2/xml/CFR-2019-title40-vol2-part51.xml#seqnum51.100) and excludes species with negligible photochemical reactivity such as ethane which are needed for photochemical modeling. [Gsref files](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/2.5/html/ch08s05s04.html) are mechanism independent and map sources to profiles and are provided as well.
  - Files labeled v0_21_Spec_5_2 are based on an interim version of CRACMM (v0.21) and an interim version of SPECIATE v5.2. Several CRACMM species were renamed in the final v1.0. See notes regarding version compatibility below.
  - Files labeled v1_Spec_5_2 match CRACMMv1.0 and interim SPECIATE v5.2. CRACMMv1 is implemented in CMAQv5.4.
  - Files labeled HTAP provide speciation for HTAP sectors (aircraft, ships, energy, industry, transport, residential, agriculture) based on U.S. 2018 emission speciation.
  - "criteria" files obtain all HAP species from speciation of total VOC (this is the general assumption for point sources)
  - "integrate" files obtain naphthalene, benzene, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and methanol from the NEI and other HAPs are from speciation of the remaining non-HAP VOC/TOG (this is the general assumption for area sources)
